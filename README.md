## Description
The purpose of this webpage is to take user input and display numerous recipes and meals that fit the description. This webpage uses 2 apis. The first of which is called edamam and is the basis for the recipe and ingredient information. By collecting an ingredient name from the user by using a form, and a button, the webpage displays recipes that include that specific ingredient. There is a feature on our webpage called a hamburger button that the user is able to interact with to add ingredients to a shopping list. The user is able to look up recipes by name or ingredient. 

## Installation
